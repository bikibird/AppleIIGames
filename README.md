# Apple II Games
## Lo-Res
The lores folder contains a collection of mostly integer BASIC games and one Applesoft game that I wrote as a teenager in the 1970's. Type them into your dusty old Apple II (or favorite emulator) and enjoy the beautiful low resolution colors.

## Hi-Res
The hires folder contains my high resolution games that were published in various magazines back in the day.  These were written in assembly language.  A disk image is provided for each game so that you can avoid pesky hexadecimal data entry.
