# Apple II Games
## Lo-Res
The lores folder contains a collection of mostly integer BASIC games and one Applesoft game that I wrote as a teenager in the 1970's. Type them into your dusty old Apple II (or favorite emulator) and enjoy the beautiful low resolution colors.

## Hi-Res
The hires folder contains my high resolution games that were published in various magazines back in the day.  These were written in assembly language.  A disk image is provided for each game so that you can avoid pesky hexadecimal data entry. 

* I wrote _Chicken Little_, a life and death battle against gravity, first at the age of 18. However, it was published last after a wait of over 10 years.  It appeared in the February 1992 issue of Nibble magazine.  The [article](https://github.com/bikibird/AppleIIGames/blob/master/hires/chickenLittle.pdf) is notable for a long tutorial on my approach to writing arcade games for the Apple II and contains a complete and commented source code listing.  It's worth studying if you are learning 6502 assembler. 

* _Spin Ball_, a two player cross between pinball and pong, was written shortly after Chicken Lttle.  It appeared in the April 1984 issue of _Nibble_ magazine.
