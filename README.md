# Apple II Games
## Lo-Res
The lores folder contains a collection of mostly integer BASIC games and one Applesoft game that I wrote as a teenager in the 1970's. Type them into your dusty old Apple II (or favorite emulator) and enjoy the beautiful low resolution colors.

## Hi-Res
The hires folder contains my high resolution games that were published in various magazines back in the day.  These were written in assembly language.  A disk image is provided for each game so that you can avoid pesky hexadecimal data entry. 

* I wrote _Chicken Little_, a life and death battle against gravity, first, at the age of 18. However, it was published last after a wait of over 10 years.  It appeared in the February 1992 issue of _Nibble_ magazine.  The [article](https://github.com/bikibird/AppleIIGames/blob/master/hires/chickenLittle.pdf) is notable for a long tutorial on my approach to writing arcade games for the Apple II and contains well commented source code listings.  It's worth studying if you are learning 6502 assembler. 

* _Spin Ball_, a two player cross between pinball and pong, was written shortly after _Chicken Lttle_.  It appeared in the April 1984 issue of _Nibble_ magazine.

* _Pond_, life and death in a drop of water, was published by [_II Computing_ in the December/January 1987 issue](https://archive.org/details/II_Computing_Vol_2_No_2_Dec_86_Jan_87/mode/2up).  The game was originally submitted as "Pond Scum", but the good taste of the editors prevailed.

* _Mosquito Madness_, an homage to summer evenings in Wisconsin and vaguely reminiscent _Space Invaders_, proves that no topic is too trivial for a game.  It appeared in the April 1988 issue of _Compute!'s Apple Applications_.
