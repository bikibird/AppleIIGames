# Apple II Games
The lores folder contains a collection of mostly integer BASIC games and one Applesoft game that I wrote as a teenager in the 1970's. Type them into your dusty old Apple II and enjoy.

The hires folder contains my hires games that were published in various magazines back in the day.  These were written in assembly language.  A disk image is provided for each game so that you can avoid hexidecimal data entry.
